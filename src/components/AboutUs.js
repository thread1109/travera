            <p>
            Being an AFS brat from my childhood I had to travel to different places with my family , in starting it was bit hard for me 
            to accomodate to new enviroment easily , to change school , friends but after some time I kind of start liking that travelling 
            visting new places exploring new things , knowing the history of different places . 
            </p>

            <h1>Motive </h1>
            <p>
            This is my personal travelling blog to make people like me who loves travelling and knowing new places aware about the 
            places and it will make easy for them to select places that they want to visit next!
            </p>
